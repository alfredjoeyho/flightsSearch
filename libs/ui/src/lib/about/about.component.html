<h3>Developer - Programming Task</h3>
<h4>Description</h4>

<p>The programming task is about creating a small application which simulates a flight search web application. The
  application gets some input from the user, makes a web service call and displays result to the user.
  In the application, you need collect following information from the user:
  • Departure airport code: a three character string. Characters can be any alphanumeric value and does not have to be a
  valid airport code. This field does not need to support auto complete or suggestion.
  • Arrival airport code: a three character string. Characters can be any alphanumeric value and does not have to be a
  valid airport code. This field does not need to support auto complete or suggestion.
  • Departure date: a date only field.
  • Return date: a date only field.
  Collected information should then be submitted to the web service.
  The web service is a fake REST service which returns JSON. The web service will search for flights and sends down the
  simulated result as a collection of JSON objects. You need to list all flights and for each of them you need to
  display</p>
<h5>
  the following information:
</h5>

<p>
  • Airline logo
  • Airline name
  • Outbound flight duration
  • Inbound flight duration
  • Total amount in USD
  Bonus: Implement search or filtering capability
  Important Notes:
  • Use Angular framework (not angularjs) to develop your web application.
  • Wherever possible, perform validation.
  • Wherever possible, the code must be unit tested.
  • Consider this application as a sub system of an enterprise application. Design your solution structure as if you
  were
  to code the whole enterprise application.
  • App should be developed assuming it will later be used for different languages and cultures
  • You are free to choose layout and design your views as you prefer.
  • For submissions, please DO NOT host your code as public. You can however host it as private git repository if you
  prefer or send us via email
  Web service technical information:
  • Web service url: http://nmflightapi.azurewebsites.net/api/flight
  • Sample request:
  "DepartureAirportCode" = "MEl",
  "ArrivalAirportCode" = "LHR",
  "DepartureDate" = "2012-12-24T00:00:00+11:00",
  "ReturnDate" = "2013-01-03T00:00:00+11:00"
